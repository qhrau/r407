When it comes to contemporary business application programming there are four major programming languages that interest me and I feel would better my career within the Management Information Systems degree. I’ll be comparing and contrasting these four languages and their listing their differences and uses. These four programming languages would be Perl, Java, C, and Python.
The first language that I would like explain in detail would be C. C is considered to be a general purpose, or procedural programming language. Compared to other programming languages C is easy to learn, efficient, and handles low levels of activity very well, as well as being capable of being compiled on many different platforms easily. C is very popular in video game programming due to it’s faster and smaller code due to its non object oriented nature. C has extensions of it’s own language as well with C++ being it’s object oriented partner. When coding in C you must run the program through a compiler to convert the code from it’s language into a functioning executable file. Some uses for C would be creation of utilities, drivers, databases, and operating systems.
	Next I would like to explain Java in detail. Java is different from C in the fact that it is focused on object oriented programming. It works in classes rather than with basic functions. Basically object orientation is the use of objects in the language and code which are essentially chunks of code that are classified as a thing, or object, that you call to receive and run separately from the main code. It resembles C++ in some ways since that is C’s object oriented counterpart. Java has the advantage of reusability within it’s programming because of it’s object oriented nature, though writing efficient code in Java can become difficult for beginners. Java is also known to be slower than C at times. Some main uses for Java would be web applications and creation of Java applets. One of the biggest advantages of Java is it’s cross platform program creation, meaning Java can be run on most any computer outside of the one it was written on through use of a Java runtime environment. This being a separate program which handles and decrypts the Java code to be run on the hardware.
